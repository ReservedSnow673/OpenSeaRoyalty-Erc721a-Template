# OpenSeaRoyalty-Erc721a-Template
With the new [OpenSea royalty policies](https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1590466349683576832), it may be necessary for new NFT contracts to implement a marketplace filtering solution. The template in this repo
utilizes the [OpenSea operator-filterer library](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/operator-filter-registry) which allows contract owners to register
a list of blocked operators.

This repo includes new royalty policy implementation for Erc721A contract standard (The one by Chiru Labs)
